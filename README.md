# MissionariesMap

Hi Ken, I added some documentation to get started in this app, good luck.

## Getting started
- You will first need to install https://code.visualstudio.com/ , this is what I use for a code editor.
- then you need to download Node js: https://nodejs.org/en/ , this will be for JavaScript librarys.
- after that you can install the Angular command line by typeing `npm install -g @angular/cli` into your terminal, you can reference the docs here: https://angular.io/cli
- If you don't have a github account you will need to create one and then download the git comand line tool, docs are here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
- After you have git installed you can do `git clone https://github.com/mikegg89/MissionariesMap.git`
- follow the prompt to cd into the app and you can use `npm i` to download all the JavaScript dependancies for the app.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Look in app/map/map.component.ts to get started in the JavaScript
Look in app/map/map.component.html to edit the HTML look and feel of the app, I set the map to be the full view of the screen but this can be adjusted with the height and width.

MissionariesMapApp is the folder for the Client side user interface app, created with Angular, you can find more documentation in the readme.md file in that folder.

Server is the folder where you can put another app that will connect to your database.

Hope this helps, feel free to reach out if you need any help.
